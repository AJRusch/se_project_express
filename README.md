This was our fist project where we got to specifically work on the back end of our WTWE project. In this project we used a variety of different middleware functions for users to pull from when either signing in, addiung a new item/clothing card, and we also set up the foundations for a like and dislike system that I imagine we will implement in the future of this project.

During the setup of this process we also gained some experience in setting up eslint and how to create some exceptions so we could properly reference our users \_Ids.

During the earlier stages of our program we were taught how important it is to keep our code clean not only for ourselves but also for our fellow engineers who may one day have to make alterations to our code. In this project I made it a point to keep everything as tidy as I can. Our Routes, Controllers, and Models are all seperated and the requisite code for those directories is kept as neatly structured as can be.
